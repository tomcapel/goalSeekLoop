# goalSeekLoop


This tool generates season long shot on target expectancies. 
Users enter the team name, their conversion rate and expected goals for the season. 
The generate button then reverse engineers their goal expectancy, using their conversion rate to generate expected shots on target for the season.
The code then executes a loop until all columns are filled.
